import { title, version, timestamp } from "./data.json";

# {title} (v{version})

## **MAP**:

    After each guess the map now zooms into the line connecting your guessed spot and the correct spot, just like the real thing.

## **Time and score**:

    Now the site also tracks how much time it took you to guess a location and gives you a score based on time and accuracy.

## **Expanding images**:

    I know a lot of you were complaining because the image was too small, now here is a solution. When you clock on an image, it shows you an upscaled version, that you can also zoom into.

## **Bugfixes**:

-   Images are not repeating anymore
-   Fixed when images are not showing sometimes
-   Fixed when location is sometimes at 0,0
-   Fixed map zooming after guessing
-   13 new images were added to the collection
