import { title, version, timestamp } from "./data.json";

# {title} (v{version})

## **Preferences**:

    On the bottom of the page there is a new button to change your preferences from dark mode to light mode or follow system default.

## **Layout**:

    I have introduced a new layout style, I hope everyone likes it.

## **Design**:

    I also made a new design, rounded everything like Windows 11 and made them look even crappier.

## **Bugfixes**:

-   Fixed image closing when dragging image outside of the center box
-   Fixed infinite distance
-   Slight performance improvements
-   Some more locations have been added (total is now 30)
